    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>As an MPA graduate student, my projected career path is to work in the public sector, specifically in public policy. I am interested in working for government agencies or non-profit organizations that aim to make a positive impact on society.
        My individual experience in this field to date includes completing an internship with a local government agency where I assisted in researching and drafting policy proposals. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of how policies are created and implemented at the local level.
        Moving forward, I anticipate making significant contributions to this field by leveraging my skills in data analysis and communication. I believe that my ability to analyze and interpret data will be crucial in making informed decisions and proposing effective policies. Additionally, my skills in communication will be essential in conveying complex information to policymakers and the public in a clear and concise manner.
        Overall, I am excited to join this field and make a positive impact on society by contributing to the creation of policies that promote equity, justice, and sustainability. I believe that by working collaboratively with others in this field, we can create a better world for everyone.
